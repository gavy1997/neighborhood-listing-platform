# AI Collaboration Log

## Assignment Checkpoint Prompt

> "Review this React component for semantic HTML, WCAG-oriented keyboard access, responsive behavior, and TypeScript safety. Return: issue, why it matters, smallest change, and a manual test. Do not claim compliance from code alone."

---

## Tool 1: ChatGPT

### Output Summary

- **Issue:** Missing explicit `type="button"` on interactive action buttons in property cards.
- **Why it matters:** Without an explicit type, buttons inside forms can accidentally trigger form submissions on Enter key press.
- **Smallest change:** Add `type="button"` to card buttons.

### Evaluation

- **Accepted suggestions:** Added explicit `type="button"` attributes across interactive components.
- **Rejected suggestions:** Recommending inline `onClick` handlers for static links; preferred native `<a>` anchors for semantic accessibility.
- **Manual test result:** Tabbed through cards with keyboard; verified buttons do not trigger unexpected form submits.

## Tool 2: Gemini

### Output Summary

- **Issue:** Lack of visible focus indicators (`focus-visible:ring-2`) on key interactive links and custom filter selects.
- **Why it matters:** Keyboard users relying on Tab navigation cannot identify which element currently has focus.
- **Smallest change:** Applied Tailwind focus ring utility classes (`focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-indigo-500`).

### Evaluation

- **Accepted suggestions:** Updated `SearchFilters` select controls and `PropertyCard` interactive links with `focus-visible:ring-2`.
- **Rejected suggestions:** Suggestions to replace standard HTML form labels with `aria-label` attributes; retained `<label>` elements for screen reader compatibility.
- **Manual test result:** Tested with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`; verified distinct outline rings on active elements.

## Checkpoint: JSON Schema and Data Contract Architecture

### Prompt Pattern Used

> "Given these fictional listing requirements, propose a strict JSON Schema. Identify ambiguous business rules before writing the schema. Then provide valid and intentionally invalid examples and explain what a validator should reject."

### Models Consulted

- **Gemini (3.5 Flash / AI Studio):** Primary generator for schema structure, Zod definitions, and structured JSON output.
- **ChatGPT:** Secondary critique for identifying edge-case normalization issues and business rule ambiguities.

### Useful Output Accepted

- Strict JSON Schema requiring core property fields and enforcing `additionalProperties: false`.
- Single source of truth Zod schema in TypeScript (`src/schemas/property.ts`).
- AJV validation script with programmatic error logging (`scripts/validate.js`).

### Rejected Output and Corrections

- **Rejected:** Initial output returned `price` as a formatted string (for example, `"$450,000"`).
  - **Correction:** Enforced a strict numeric constraint (`"type": "number"`, `"minimum": 0`) in the prompt system instructions and schema definition.
- **Rejected:** Permitted loose free-text strings for `amenities` (for example, `"Central AC"` versus `"air-conditioning"`).
  - **Correction:** Adopted controlled enum values in the Zod contract and documented the decision in `docs/adr/001-data-contract.md`.

### Verification Summary

- **Seed records:** 100% of generated records passed local AJV validation (`node scripts/validate.js`).
- **Invalid fixtures:** Unit tests verified failure cases for missing ID, negative price, invalid ZIP format, and unexpected additional fields.
- **Privacy verification:** Confirmed zero personal, secret, or real client data present in prompts or committed files.

---

## Boundary Validation Implementation

- Implemented Zod schema parsing in `src/lib/api.ts`.
- Structured directory hierarchy (`src/lib/` and `src/test/`) and verified native TypeScript execution via `tsx`.
- Verified JSON schema validation using `node scripts/validate.js`.

## Midterm Practical Exam — Initial Requirements Draft

- **Tool:** ChatGPT
- **Prompt:** "Please explain these two assignments, and let's do them for this class for Rahim Islam step by step." The exam instructions were provided as context.
- **Output used:** The three user stories, acceptance criteria, estimates, traceability paths, and open questions in `docs/requirements.md`.
- **Output rejected / rationale:** No implementation or security claims were accepted without checking the migration, routes, and test results. The district/coverage-zone and booking-policy details remained open questions because the instructions did not fully define them.
- **Verification:** Compared the stories with the three stakeholder roles and requirements in the exam instructions; recorded unresolved schema questions in `docs/requirements.md`.
- **Associated commit:** `64089bf`
- **Other AI tools:** Gemini and Google AI Studio were not used for this requirements draft.

## Midterm Practical Exam — Services and Bookings Implementation

- **Tool:** ChatGPT
- **Prompt summary:** Help implement and verify service listings, booking requests, administrator booking review, and draft service approval for the midterm.
- **Output used:** Assistance with the Supabase migration and grants, Zod validation, service and booking API routes, admin routes, and service catalog UI.
- **Verification:** Applied the migration and grants in Supabase. Confirmed anonymous booking reads are denied, a provider can read their own service bookings, another authenticated user sees no bookings, an admin can read bookings and approve a draft service, a provider's approval attempt returns HTTP 403, and the approved service appears in the public services query.
- **Test results:** `npm test` passed (8 tests). `npm run build` passed, including `/api/admin/bookings` and `/api/admin/services`.
- **Limitations:** The approval check used fictional test data. The migration grants were also applied directly in Supabase; the local migration includes them so the setup is reproducible.
- **Associated commit:** `d5952ef`
